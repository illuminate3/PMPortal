backups

1) AUTOMATIC BACKUP

I created a batch file scheduler.bat with the following contents:
	cd C:\xampp\htdocs\PMPortal
	php artisan backup:run --only-db
Then launch the task scheduler Windows Key + R then paste in Taskschd.msc and hit enter.

Then click Create Basic Task on the right in the Actions pane.

Name your task something so you will know what it is for if you need to modify it or are running multiple projects then click Next.

Leave this page set to Daily for now and click Next. 

Leave this page as defaults as well and click Next.

Make sure Start a Program is selected and click Next.

Browse to the batch file we just created and then click Next then click Finish.

Now, select Task Scheduler Library on the left, and find your task in the middle pane and right-click and click Properties

Go to the Triggers tab, click Daily in the list and click Edit. (edit this if you want to)

The drop-down at the top next to Begin the task change to At Log on for Any user

Check the box that says Repeat Task Every and choose 5 Minutes from the drop-down. The drop-down after for a duration: on the same line choose Indefinitely.

Click OK. Done.

Then right-click on your task in the middle pane and click Run to initiate it.

2) changing where backups will be stored

go to PMPortal/config/filesystems.php and change 'local' to whatever root directory you want
then go PMPortal/config/laravel-backup.php and change 'path' under 'destination' to whatever folder you want under the root directory

3) to restore database
go to command line
>> cd C:\['insert path where dump file is stored']
>> mysql -u root
>> create database PMPortal; //if not exists
>> use database PMPortal;
>> source dump.sql;


--------------------

activity log: 
By default records older than 2 months will be deleted. The number of months can be modified in the config-file of the package.

---------------------

current: delete backups = delete all backups
to delete backups older than a certain date, go to fileselector.php and uncomment the commented code under filterFilesOnDate.
you can also go to laravel-backup.php and change maxAgeInDays to change which backups should be deleted depending on how old they are.

--------------------

play around with backupcommand.php and cleancommand.php for the backup feature
